*Please Note* there are a few serious bugs with this embryonic version.  See Issues for details.

TBD.

You need Microsoft's .NET Framework 4.5 .

Copy the files in Binaries/ to your VST folder and rescan within your DAW.

Please note that for FL Studio, I had to put the file FL.exe.config (under Support/) in the same folder as FL.exe for it to work.  Still digging into this. 


Credits
-------
This VST was developed using the excellent VST.NET Library from Jacobi Software (see http://vstnet.codeplex.com/).

In fact, the MidiMapper sample program included with VST.NET was used as the basis, so thany thanks to 'obiwanjacobi' from Jacobi Software.
