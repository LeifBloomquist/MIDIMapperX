*Please Note* Only the 32-bit version is properly working at this time.

If you get .NET permission errors, you may have to put the file FL.exe.config (under Support/) in the same folder as FL.exe for it to work.  May be optional.

-------
This VST was developed using the excellent VST.NET Library from Jacobi Software (see http://vstnet.codeplex.com/).

In fact, the MidiMapper sample program included with VST.NET was used as the basis, so thany thanks to 'obiwanjacobi' from Jacobi Software.
